<p> I want to reconnect with the power of my natural, authentic voice.</p>

	<p>Freeing my natural voice is a path that leades to reconnecting with  my authentic self, which is what I've been trying to do for more than two decades living in the INDIA.

		<p>I have tride cognitive behavioral therapy, overcoming social anxiety, taking voice lessons, singing lesson, advance public speaking, communication and acting classes, dating and pickiup, meetups, festival, social club. None of these activity got me the results and fulfillment I was seeking.</p>

			<p>After being on a radical journey of spiritual transformation over the past three years I realize what I've been trying to do this whole time is to be myself. I've bee trying to reconnect with a sense of self that I've lost since I moved to the INDIA.</p>

				<p>Now that Im experimenting with opening up my natural voice and my authetic style of speaking. Im starting reconnect with that true essense that I've lost and have been searching for all these years.</p>

					<p>I have accumulated great wisdom from the journey of spiritual healing and transformation on how to reconnect with my natural voice in a gradual, gentle and loving way, and I believe sharing insights on how to do that will be of great value to other people.</p>

						<p>when we are truly in touch with the power of our voice, speaking becomes joy and medicine. Anything you talk about can be joy for you and medicine for other people. This is what Im currently striving to accomplish by working on my own voice.</p>

							<p>By making social athering I'll be able to help my own process of reconnecting with my natural voice and authentic self because Im still in the process of regaining my voice.</p>

								<p>As I become more comforatable with my own voice, Im hoping to connect with people beyond words, Im hoping to express muself with kind of energy that will speak to people on a soul level. I want to embody truth, love and beauty of creation and speak with the energy that will comunnicate all these values that I want to embody and share.</p>
